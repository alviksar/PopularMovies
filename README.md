# PopularMovies
The Udacity project: An app to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing.

Note.
There should be added the app/src/main/res/values/api_keys.xml file with API_KEY for the http://api.themoviedb.org requests. 
This file should include a string resource themoviedb_v3_key.

\<string name="themoviedb_v3_key"\>[API_KEY]\</string\>
